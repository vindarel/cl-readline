:GETC function is used to get a character from the input stream, thus
FUNCTION should take pointer to C stream and return a character if this
function is desired to be registered. In general, an application that
registers :GETC function should consider registering :INPUTP hook as
well (see REGISTER-HOOK).

:REDISPLAY function is used to update the display with the current contents
of the editing buffer, thus FUNCTION should take no arguments and return NIL
on success and non-NIL of failure. By default, it is set to REDISPLAY, the
default Readline redisplay function.

:PREP-TERM function is used to initialize the terminal, so FUNCTION must be
able to take one argument, a flag that says whether or not to use eight-bit
characters. By default, PREP-TERMINAL is used.

:DEPREP-TERM function is used to reset the terminal. This function should
undo the effects of :PREP-TERM function.

:COMPLETE function is used to generate list of possible completions for
given partially entered word. The function must be able to take three
arguments: partially entered word, start index of the word in *LINE-BUFFER*
and end index of the word in the buffer. The function must return a list
where first element is the actual completion (or part of completion if two
or more completions share common prefix) and the rest arguments are possible
completions.

Other values of FUNC will be ignored.

FUNCTION must be a function, if FUNCTION is NIL, result is unpredictable."
